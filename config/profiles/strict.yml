# Strict profile: additional enforcement for teams ready to adopt more rules.
# Enable after baseline has been adopted and violations addressed.
#
# Usage in .rubocop.yml:
#   inherit_from:
#     - rubocop-method-name-get-prefix:config/profiles/strict.yml

inherit_from:
  - ../default.yml

# Strict profile: same as baseline for now.
# Future cops (e.g., RailsArchitecture/*, RailsSafety/*) can be enabled here
# as they are added to the extension.
